this is the final part of the Prog POE and is all about connecting the database used in part 1 and putting it in a MVC.This application allows users to login or resigster by using their name and their password.this application allows the user to add details about their modules such as the modules code  eg Prog6212 , name , credits of the module , Hours spent on module , weeks of the module , start date of the moduleand semseter.i used visual studio because it is the best coding app , MVC was used cause it allows the database to be displayed on a website.i faced many coding chalenges like the modules not showing the data properly and the coding for regersitng , i would like to improve on these in the future.to run the project the user will need to install vusaul studios 2022 and use microsoft sql server management, this will allow the code to run and the database to be accessed .the user will need to make sure the correct nuget packages are installed on their device.
